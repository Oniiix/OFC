Made in 48H for the Global Game Jam 2025 (Theme: Bubbles).

Note : Only the game's logo was AI-generated.



Your objective is to save as many ducks as possible by putting them in the enclosure, and remove any of the mischievious foxes that come to take them away!

Use your Bubble Gun to put ducks or foxes into bubbles, which you can suck into your weapon to shoot them back wherever you want.

Put the ducks in the enclosure, and throw the foxes onto the thorns to make them disappear !

Once all foxes have been removed, you can buy upgrades to your gun before starting the next wave.

All ducks safely put inside the enclosure before the end of each wave each give you 1 point to spend.

Now go help those defensless ducks!

##Controls (AZERTY Keyboard Layout) :


ZQSD  : Move

Left Click : Shoot bubble

Right Click : Suck in bubbles

Spacebar : Jump



## Bubble types :

There are four flowers that generate bubbles of different types. Sucking those in changes the type of bubbles your weapon can shoot.

Soap Bubbles
The default bubbles, they can only hold an animal for up to 2 seconds
Bubblegum Bubbles
Those bubbles move slower, but they can hold an animal forever
Oil Bubbles
Those bubbles bounce around without stopping
Mercury Bubbles
If those bubbles pop, they make whatever they hold disappear (however you can still safely put ducks into the enclosure with these)
